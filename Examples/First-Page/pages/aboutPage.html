<div id="aboutpage">
    <h1 align="center">About Page</h1>
    <p>I have introduced dynamic page changes and content js on this page.</p>
    <p>My name is Hasan HÃ¼seyin Demir.I own this project.</p> <p>I'm glad you tried my framework</p> I hope you like it. Many more features will be added.
    <p>If you want to use this framework, you just need to add it to the page as a cdn file.<br>
    for instance = &#60;script src="CDN Link"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
    </p>
    <p>This page only shows the mobility of the variables. I request you to look at the source files of this page. Because we haven't even touched on the file structure and composition feature yet :)</p>
    <b>I wanted to prepare a dynamic framework that is easy to use and does not require package installation.</b>   
    Some features of contentjs are introduced on this page. More to come. See you :)...
